## Description

_This is a basic HTML webpage that uses Bootstrap's grid system and panels to modulize the layout of my content. It also employs a small Javascript tag to toggle between regular and party mode._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download entire repo
* Open index.html in browser
* If it doesn't work, it may require having Bootstrap 3.3.7 CSS file in CSS folder and jQuery 3.4.1 JS file in JS folder

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_
